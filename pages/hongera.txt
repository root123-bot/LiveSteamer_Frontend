Pasko now umekuwa mtaalamu kidogo nimependa hii umeona
ulivyo-injunga ImageInput2.js  and team.js ulivyoifanya 
japo kuwa value ipo kwenye nested component of ImageInput2
lakini umeweza kui-clear na logic uliyotumia au law uliyotumia 
hapa ni "EVERYTIME STATE CHANGE THE COMPONENT RE-RENDER' IN OUR 
CASE HERE WE ADD A STATE TO WATCHDOG AFTER THE USER SAVING THE 
LAST COMPETITION TO NOT DISPLAY/USE THE PREVIOUS STATE SAVED.. ULICHOKIFANYA
NI KUWEKA HII STATE SO MTU AKISHASAVE COMPETITION INA-CHANGE  TO 'FALSE/UNDEFINED'
BY CHANGING IT SHOULD MAKE COMPONENT(AND ITS NESTED) TO RE-RENDER THEN
YOU TOOK THIS STATE CHANGING AS DEPENDENCY TO OUR NESTED COMPONENT(ImageInput2)
WHERE THE ACTUAL VALUE FOUND AND SHOULD BE CLEARED, YOU DID THIS THEN TO KEEP TRACK
YOU USELAYOUTEFFECT() AND ADD THSI STATE CHANGING AS DEPENDENCY SO EVERTYTIME IT
CHANGE IN OUR PARENT(team.JS) to ALSO CLEAR THE IMAGE SAVED IN STATE AND HAPA NDO ULIPOFANIKIWA
JIPONGEZE
